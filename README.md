===============================

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).


Frogger Arcade Game - Classic Arcade Game

This is my clone of the Classic game, Frogger.

To open the Game:
clone the directory and open the index.html in browser.

Rules of the Game:
Start with 3 lives (Hearts), every successful crossing to the other side of the road will give you 3 stars.
BUT... Each collision will cost you 1 heart life and 1 star.
Lose 3 hearts/lives and game over!

To Play the Game:
Use the keyboard arrow keys on your keyboard to move your player up, down, right, and left around the board.

How to Win:
Successfully move your player across the board to the water without colliding with the enemy bugs.
